I have a lot's of coin of 10 - 20 cents. But is heavt and hard do use in real life in a real store.

I wanted to use my small coins in a store. But for 35â‚¬ it tooks us 3-5 minutes. Meaning that you blocks every one in the queue.
And they refused the 10 cents.

So What I want to have is some ready to be use pack of small coint that a store would think:
"Ok that easy to count let's accept them."

And pack that are easily transportable as I am nomade.
